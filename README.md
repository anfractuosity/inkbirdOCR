# inkbirdOCR

Using SSOCR to OCR an Inkbird for graphing fermentation

I've created two scripts:

# log-closest-to-target.sh

Finds the OCR'd value which is closest to the target value you specify in the script.

# log-most-common.sh

Finds the OCR'd value which appears the most common (doesn't require you to specify a target value).

# Hardware

See https://www.anfractuosity.com/projects/fermentation-temperature-control-with-inkbird-308/ for more details on how the hardware is setup.
